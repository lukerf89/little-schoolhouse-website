                <p class="subtitle font-display">Where Learning Feels Like Home</p>
                <p>Hi, I'm Luke. My wife Natalie and I live in the Arkansas Ozarks with our four kids, and we've made the decision to homeschool. But here's the thing nobody tells you about homeschooling: the curriculum planning will absolutely take over your life if you let it.</p>
                
                <p>So we're sitting here, surrounded by curriculum catalogs, drowning in Facebook group recommendations, spending our evenings researching Charlotte Mason versus Classical education, and honestly? We thought there had to be a better way.</p>
                
                <p>That's why we're building Little Schoolhouse—a homeschool companion inspired by those one-room prairie schoolhouses where learning was personal, values-centered, and beautifully simple. We're building it for our own family first, but we'd love to share it with yours too.</p>

            <h2 class="font-display">Why We're Building This (And Why We Need Your Help)</h2>
            
            <p>So here's our situation. We have four kids who we're about to start homeschooling, and we're discovering that curriculum planning is basically a part-time job. We're talking 10+ hours a week researching options, trying to figure out what aligns with our values, what works for multiple kids at different levels, and how to make sure we're not missing anything important.</p>
            
            <p>All while running a business, managing our farm, dealing with Arkansas LEARNS Act requirements, and, you know, actually raising four kids.</p>
            
            <p>I started wondering: what if there was a way to create a personalized curriculum plan in 30 minutes instead of 30 hours? What if we could build something that actually understands our family's values, our kids' learning styles, and our crazy busy life? Something inspired by those simple one-room schoolhouses where education was tailored to each child, rooted in great books, and connected to real life?</p>
            
            <p>That's what we're working on. Not just for other families, but for ourselves. Because if we're going to homeschool our own kids, we need this tool to actually work.</p>

            <h2 class="font-display">Education Like It Used to Be</h2>
            
            <p>Picture a prairie schoolhouse where children of all ages learn together, where great books come alive, where faith and learning intertwine naturally, and where education adapts to each child's needs and interests.</p>
            
            <p>That's the heart of Little Schoolhouse—a homeschool companion that honors the wisdom of classical education while embracing the flexibility modern families need. We're talking about curriculum planning that integrates your family's values from the ground up, adapts for siblings at different levels, and actually fits into your real life.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're drawn to Charlotte Mason's living books, classical education's great conversation, or just want learning that feels natural and joyful—we're building something that gets your family.</p>

            <h2 class="font-display">What We're Discovering About Curriculum Planning</h2>
            
            <p>We've spent entire weekends comparing curriculum options. We've read probably 200+ reviews. We've asked for advice in every Arkansas homeschool Facebook group we could find. And you know what we discovered? Most families are going through the exact same struggle we are.</p>
            
            <div class="card mt-4">
                <h3>The Time Sink</h3>
                <p>We're spending more time planning curriculum than we are actually teaching our kids.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Decision Paralysis</h3>
                <p>There are literally hundreds of curriculum options, and everyone has opinions about what's "best."</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">The Multi-Kid Challenge</h3>
                <p>Planning for different ages and learning styles while keeping everyone engaged? It's like solving a puzzle that keeps changing.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">Values Alignment</h3>
                <p>We want our kids' education to reflect our family's values, but most curriculum is either too generic or too rigid.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="mt-4">So we're working on something different. Something that would create a full-year curriculum plan based on your family's specific values, each child's learning style, your schedule and lifestyle, and yes—Arkansas compliance built right in so you never worry about missing requirements.</p>
