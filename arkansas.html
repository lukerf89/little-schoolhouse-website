            <h2>Arkansas LEARNS Act: What I Found Out (So You Don't Have To)</h2>
            
            <p>Okay, so when Natalie and I decided to homeschool, one of my first questions was: "What does this LEARNS Act thing mean for us?"</p>
            
            <p>I'm kind of a research nerd, so I went down a rabbit hole. I read the actual legislation. I called the Department of Education. I talked to other families. I joined every Arkansas homeschool Facebook group I could find. And honestly? I got pretty frustrated with how confusing and contradictory the information was online.</p>
            
            <p>Some people were saying LEARNS Act created all these new requirements. Others were saying it changed nothing. Some were talking about mandatory testing. Others were saying Arkansas has no testing requirements. I was getting more confused, not less.</p>
            
            <p>So I decided to figure this out once and for all. Here's what I learned, in plain English:</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--warm-white);">The Short Answer: LEARNS Act Changes Nothing for Most Homeschoolers</h2>
                
                <p>If you're planning to homeschool the traditional way (like we are), the LEARNS Act doesn't create any new requirements for you. At all. Zero. None.</p>
                
                <p>The only thing you have to do is file a Notice of Intent by August 15. That's it. Same as it's been for years.</p>
                
                <p>The LEARNS Act does create a new optional program called Education Freedom Accounts that gives you $6,864+ per kid, but it comes with strings attached (testing, specific subjects, etc.). You can choose to participate or not. More on that below.</p>

            <h2>Arkansas is Actually Amazing for Homeschoolers</h2>
            
            <p>After researching other states, I realized we're incredibly blessed to live in Arkansas. Seriously, Arkansas is one of the most family-friendly homeschool states in the country.</p>
            
            <div class="card mb-4">
                <h3>The Requirements (All of Them):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>File Notice of Intent by August 15 - Takes like 10 minutes online</li>
                    <li>Your kids need to be between ages 5-17 - Standard compulsory attendance thing</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>That's it. That's literally the entire list.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>What Arkansas DOESN'T Require:</h3>
                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>✅ No mandated subjects (you choose what to teach based on your family's values)</li>
                    <li>✅ No required curriculum (use whatever fits your family—Charlotte Mason, Classical, whatever)</li>
                    <li>✅ No standardized testing (unless you want to do it)</li>
                    <li>✅ No minimum hours or days (complete flexibility to structure your year)</li>
                    <li>✅ No required record-keeping (though I'd recommend it for your own peace of mind)</li>
                    <li>✅ No annual reports beyond that Notice of Intent</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mt-3">Honestly, compared to states like New York or Pennsylvania where families have to submit detailed lesson plans and test scores, Arkansas is basically homeschool paradise.</p>

            <h2>Education Freedom Accounts (EFA) - The Optional Route</h2>
            
            <p>Starting this school year (2025-2026), Arkansas families can choose to participate in the Education Freedom Account program. Here's the deal:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>$6,864+ per student annually (paid quarterly)</li>
                        <li>Use funds for curriculum, materials, tutoring, testing, technology, etc.</li>
                        <li>Available to ALL Arkansas families (no income limits, no geographic restrictions)</li>

                    <h3>EFA Requirements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must teach English, Math, Science, and Social Studies</li>
                        <li>Annual standardized testing REQUIRED</li>
                        <li>Report test results to the state</li>
                        <li>Use funds only for approved educational expenses</li>
                        <li>More state oversight and paperwork</li>

            <div class="card mt-4">
                <h3>My Take:</h3>
                <p>For our family, we're planning to stick with traditional homeschooling. We want the complete freedom to follow our kids' interests, use whatever curriculum fits our values, and not worry about test scores or state oversight.</p>
                
                <p>But I can see how the EFA funding could be really helpful for some families, especially if you're already planning to use a more structured curriculum and don't mind the testing requirements. $6,864 per kid is real money that could buy a lot of great curriculum and resources.</p>
                
                <p>It's a personal choice, and the beautiful thing is that Arkansas gives you options.</p>

                <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>After all my research, here's what gave me peace of mind: Arkansas trusts parents to educate their children. Whether you choose traditional homeschooling or participate in the EFA program, you have incredible freedom to create an education that fits your family's values and your children's needs.</p>
                
                <p>The state basically says: "File your Notice of Intent so we know you're homeschooling, and then go create something beautiful for your kids."</p>
                
                <p>And that's exactly what we're hoping to help other families do with Little Schoolhouse—create curriculum that's both excellent and authentically yours.</p>
