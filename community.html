            <h2>Building Community, One Family at a Time</h2>
            
            <p>One thing we've discovered in this whole homeschool research process: Arkansas homeschool families are incredibly generous with sharing their experience. We've learned so much from connecting with other families who are on this journey.</p>
            
            <p>We're not experts—we're just parents trying to figure this out like everyone else. But we're finding that when families share their real experiences, everyone benefits.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            
            <p>Hi, I'm Luke, and this is my wife Natalie. We live on a small farm in the Arkansas Ozarks with our four kids. We run a business, raise chickens, grow a garden, and are about to embark on this homeschool adventure.</p>
            
            <p>I tend to be the research guy—when we decided to homeschool, I dove deep into curriculum options, Arkansas laws, educational philosophy, the whole works. Natalie keeps me grounded and reminds me that the best curriculum is the one you actually use with your kids.</p>
            
            <p>We're drawn to the Charlotte Mason approach—living books, nature study, character formation, learning that feels natural and joyful. But we're also practical parents who need something that works with our real life: running a business, managing a farm, and raising four kids who are all different.</p>
            
            <p>That's why we're building Little Schoolhouse. We need curriculum planning that actually gets our family, and we suspect other families might benefit from that too.</p>

            <h2>Questions We're Asking (Maybe You Are Too?)</h2>
            
            <p>As we talk to more Arkansas families, we keep hearing similar challenges:</p>
            
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>How do you balance multiple kids at different levels without losing your mind?</li>
                <li>What curriculum actually aligns with your family's values instead of just claiming to?</li>
                <li>How do you handle the time demands of planning while actually living life?</li>
                <li>What would make curriculum planning feel enjoyable instead of overwhelming?</li>
                <li>How do you integrate Arkansas requirements without letting them drive your educational philosophy?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We're gathering insights from families like ours to understand what would actually be helpful. Not what curriculum companies think we need, but what real families with real lives actually need.</p>
